2. 7.2 The Issuer will endeavour to promptly inform you of any such decision to migrate blockchain support via your contact email eddress, together with instructions on how to receive and use Replacement Tokens of an equivalent number to any Discontinued Tokens that you may hold at the relevant time at a Token Address.
3. 7.3 Any such instructions will necessarily require you to have designated in your name a Token Address on the blockchain for which the Replacement Tokens have been designed, which, if you do not already have one, can be obtained by submitting a new Token Registration Request.
4. 7.4 The migration of blockchain support will constitute a variation of these Terms in accordance with the procedures and timeframes set out in these Terms. Any such variation will involve the smart contract code for the Discontinued Tokens ceasing to constitute, and the smart contract code for the Replacement Tokens thereafter being designated as a Token Smart Contract for the purposes of these Terms. You agree and acknowledge that retaining continued access to the full functionality and utility on the Issuer Protocol of any Tokens that you hold may require you, in the event that the smart contract code controlling such Tokens subsequently ceases to constitute a Token Smart Contract, to utilise thereafter the addresses for any Token Smart Contract deployed as a replacement for the receipt, use or disposal of Tokens, in accordance with the instructions issued and conditions stipulated by the Issuer.

### 8. Representations and Warranties

1. 8.1 You represent and warrant on the date of accepting these Terms, which representations and warranties will be deemed repeated on each date on which these Terms are in effect as between you and the Issuer, the following:

### 12. Entire Agreement

1. 12.1 These Terms represent the entire agreement (and understanding) between the Issuer and you, and supersedes any previous dealings between the parties relating to the subject matter of these Terms.
2. 12.2 In entering into these Terms, you do not rely on, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any statement, representation, warranty or understanding (whether negligently or innocently made) of any person (whether a party to these Terms or not) other than as expressly set out in these Terms.

### 13. Nature of the Terms

Nothing in these Terms is intended to, or shall be deemed to establish any partnership or joint venture between you and the Issuer, constitute any party the agent of another party, or authorise any party to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of any other party.

### 14. Interpretation

All determinations and calculations under, and any interpretation of these Terms, will be undertaken by the Issuer (in its sole and absolute discretion) and that as between the parties to these Terms, such determinations, calculations and interpretations will be final and binding.

### 15. Token Smart Contracts

1. 15.1 Certain operational aspects of your access to and use of Tokens are controlled by sets of smart contract code, as issued, deployed, supported and maintained by the Issuer from time to time (each such set, a “Token Smart Contract”). Details of the addresses on the relevant public network blockchains for the current Token Smart Contracts can be found at the address provided in the technical details section above.
2. 15.2 In the event of any conflict between the code in any of the Token Smart Contracts and these Terms, the provisions of these Terms shall prevail.
3. 15.3 In the event that the Issuer identifies or is made aware of any discrepancy between the software code of any of the Token Smart Contracts and the text of this document, the Issuer will use reasonable endeavours to rectify such discrepancy.
4. 15.4 All Token Smart Contracts will be deployed by the Issuer from the applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, you acknowledge that any transfer of title to Tokens effected by the operation of any Token Smart Contract will take place in the jurisdiction.
5. 15.5 The Issuer reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to change such official name designation at any time and from time to time, by operation of a name change function incorporated into the Token Smart Contracts.

### 16. Notices

1. 16.1 For the purposes of these notice provisions, ‘notice’ includes any form of official communication from the Issuer to you. A notice given to you under or in connection with these Terms:
   1. a) shall be in writing and in the English language; 
   2. b) shall in respect of any variation to these Terms, be uploaded online on the Issuer’s website and by updating the “Effective from” date above; 
   3. c) shall in respect of any variation to aspects of the Tokens, be notified by posting a Protocol Update Notice as soon as reasonably practicable at https://blockpass.org/terms/. Alternatively, or in addition, Blockpass may also at its discretion elect to send you equivalent notification via your local copy of the Blockpass App;
   4.  d) May in respect of any type of notice be sent to you via the contact email address provided by you.
2. 16.2 Delivery of a notice is deemed to have taken place at the time of sending or uploading unless such time would occur outside business hours in the place of deemed receipt, in which case it shall be deemed to have been received at 9.00 am on the day when business next starts in the place of deemed receipt. For the purposes of this clause, all references to time are to local time in the place of deemed receipt.
3. 16.3 To prove service via email, it is sufficient for the Issuer to prove that the email containing the notice was properly addressed, and left the Issuer’s computer systems and no erroneous transmission report was received advising that the email was not successfully delivered.
4. 16.4 These notice provisions do not apply to the service of any proceedings or other documents in any legal action or any arbitration or other method of dispute resolution, which are instead subject to the notice provisions described in their specific clauses.

### 17. Severance

If any provision or part-provision of these Terms is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any relevant jurisdiction, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable. If such modification is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion of a provision or part-provision under this severance provision shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of these Terms.

### 18. Indemnity

1. 18.1 To the fullest extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Issuer and the Issuer’s respective past, present and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns (each, an “Issuer Party”, and collectively, the “Issuer Parties”) from and against all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including lawyers’ fees and including for the avoidance of doubt any fines or other sanctions imposed on the Issuer and/or any other Issuer Party as a result of any alleged breach of applicable law or regulation) that arise from or relate to: (i) your access to, acquisition, retention, use or disposal of any Tokens; (ii) your access to or use of any of the services attached to any Tokens; or (iii) any other violation of these Terms by you.
2. 18.2 We reserve the right to exercise sole control over the defence, at your expense, of any claim subject to indemnification pursuant to these Terms. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in these Terms or any other written agreement between you and any one or more of the Issuer Parties.
3. 18.3 Without prejudice to any other right or remedy the Issuer may have, you shall indemnify the Issuer against all costs and expenses incurred by the Issuer in investigating your affairs and in rescinding or terminating these Terms in the event that your circumstances or actions cause the Issuer to incur such costs and expenses. 

### 19. Waiver

1. 19.1 A waiver of any right or remedy under these Terms or by law is only effective if it is given in writing. Any such waiver shall apply only to the circumstances for which it is given and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.
2. 19.2 A failure or delay by the Issuer to exercise any right or remedy provided under these Terms or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict any further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy provided under these Terms or by law shall prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
3. 19.3 A party that waives a right or remedy provided under these Terms or by law in relation to one party, or takes or fails to take any action against that party, does not affect its rights in relation to any other party.

### 20. Third Party Rights

No one other than a party to these Terms, their personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns shall have any right to enforce any of these Terms. 

### 21. Rights and Remedies

1. 21.1 Except as expressly provided in these Terms, the rights and remedies provided under these Terms are in addition to, and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.
2. 21.2 Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Issuer may have, you acknowledge and agree that damages alone may not be an adequate remedy for the Issuer in respect of any breach by you of these Terms. Accordingly, the Issuer shall be entitled to seek the remedies of injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of these Terms (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, in relation to your undertaking not to engage in market abuse or market manipulation).

### 22. Variation

1. 22.1 The Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, and from time to time, vary any or all of these Terms, or may vary, suspend or terminate any aspects of the Tokens (or the rights attached or the services related to such Tokens) immediately and without prior notice to you (such notice to be provided as soon as is reasonably practicable after the event described in this clause has occurred) if:
   1. 22.1.1 the Issuer ascertains that there has been a change in any law or any regulation applicable to any matter arising under or in connection with these Terms, and that such action is necessary or prudent to ensure continued legal and regulatory compliance; or
   2. 22.1.2  the Issuer identifies any flaws, bugs, defects or inconsistencies in the source code that could compromise the predictability, usability, functionality, stability, and/or security of Tokens.
2. 22.2 Subject to clause 22.1, in all other circumstances, the Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, and from time to time, vary these Terms upon giving you reasonable notice of the proposed variations. The variations will come into effect and if on and from that date you are still in possession or use Tokens, you will be deemed to have accepted the variations.

### 23. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

1. 23.1 These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Isle of Man.
2. 23.2 Subject to the mediation provisions in sub-clause 23.6, all disputes (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any question regarding their existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause.
   1. a) The number of arbitrators shall be one.
   2. b) The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be London.

3. 23.3 The parties undertake as a general principle to keep confidential all awards in their arbitration, together with all materials in the arbitration created for the purpose of the arbitration and all other documents produced by another party in the proceedings not otherwise in the public domain, save and to the extent that disclosure may be required of a party by legal duty, to protect or pursue a legal right, or to enforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings before a state court or other legal authority.
4. 23.4 The deliberations of the arbitral tribunal shall remain confidential to its members, save as required by any applicable law and to the extent that disclosure of an arbitrator’ refusal to participate in the arbitration is required of the other members of the arbitral tribunal under Articles 10, 12, 26 and 27 of the LCIA Rules.
5. 23.5 In relation to the arbitration, you further agree that:
6. 23.5.1 the Issuer may effect delivery to you of any written communication in connection with the arbitration by electronic means using your contact email address; and
7. 23.5.2 you will effect delivery to the Issuer of any written communication in connection with the arbitration at the registered address of the Issuer as stated in the Form.
8. 23.6 If any dispute arises in connection with circumstances relating to these Terms the parties will, within thirty (30) calendar days of a written request from one party to the other, meet in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute, in accordance with the following procedure:
   1. a) If the dispute is not wholly resolved at that meeting, the parties agree to enter into mediation to settle such a dispute and will do so in accordance with the CEDR Model Mediation Procedure (unless otherwise stated in the form). 
   2. b) Unless otherwise agreed between the parties within fourteen (14) calendar days of notice of the dispute, the mediator will be nominated by CEDR. To initiate the mediation a party must give notice in writing (“ADR Notice”) to the other part(ies) to the dispute, referring the dispute to mediation. A copy of the request should be sent to CEDR. 
   3. c) Unless otherwise agreed, the mediation will start not later than thirty (30) days after the date of the ADR Notice.
   4. d) No party may commence any arbitration or court proceedings in relation to any dispute arising out of these Terms until it has attempted to settle the dispute by mediation and either the mediation has terminated or the other party has failed to participate in the mediation, provided that the right to issue proceedings is not prejudiced by a delay.
9. 23.7 In relation to mediation, you further agree that: (a) the Issuer may effect delivery to you of any written communication in connection with this mediation by electronic means using your contact email address; and (b) you will effect delivery to the Issuer of any written communication in connection with this mediation at the email legal@blockpass.org
10. 23.8 You waive the right to participate in any class action lawsuit, class arbitration or any other type of representative proceeding against the Issuer relating to (i) the access to, acquisition, retention, use or disposal of any Tokens; and/or (ii) the access or use of any of the services attached to any Tokens.

## APPENDIX 1

### STANDARD RISKS

By accepting these Terms, you expressly acknowledge and to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations, assume sole responsibility for the following risks:

**Tokens are not controlled by the Issuer** – The Issuer does not have access to your private keys. If you lose access to your Tokens there is nothing that the Issuer can do in terms of restoring Tokens to you. You are therefore solely responsible for implementing and maintaining adequate security measures for the private keys associated with any such address.

**Amendment, suspension or termination due to ongoing legal advice** – As of the date of these Terms, the Issuer continues to seek legal advice on a number of matters relating to the Tokens. Such legal advice may result in changes (including suspension or termination) to any of the operation of a Token distribution, initial coin offering or similar, the structure of and rights attached to Tokens, or the servicing of such rights by the Issuer. Any such changes may have adverse effects on the utility and legitimacy of Tokens.

**Limited Availability of Sufficient Information** – While prospective and current Registered Token Holders will have access to key information in relation to the Issuer Protocol, the Token Issuance Programme, and the structure of and rights attached to Tokens, each of these elements is still in a relatively early development phase and subject to adjustments and updates from time to time. Accordingly, prospective and current Registered Token Holders may not have full access to all relevant information prior to acquiring, utilising or divesting of any Tokens.

**Legal and regulatory characterisation and compliance** – The Tokens, Token distribution, initial coin offering or similar, the structure of and rights attached to Tokens, and/or the servicing of such rights by the Issuer may be regulated by the legal and regulatory authorities of a number of jurisdictions globally, as well as subject to evolving and untested legal and regulatory frameworks. Changes in regulatory or legal policies, or to the substance or interpretation of regulatory or legal frameworks may adversely impact on the utility, legitimacy, legality, or legal or regulatory characterisation of Tokens. To the extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations, such legal and/or regulatory risks in any relevant jurisdiction howsoever arising shall be borne by you as a Registered Token Holder alone and shall not in any way be the responsibility of the Issuer. Prospective and current Token Holders should consider consulting their legal advisors prior to the acquisition of any Tokens and are solely responsible for ensuring that their acquisition, holding or disposal of any Tokens and their use of any services associated with such Tokens comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions.

**Non-completion/Non-compliance with Customer Due Diligence Requirements** – You may suffer losses if you fail to satisfy at any time the Issuer’s customer due diligence requirements (including as set out in the Customer Due Diligence Policy).
Compromised Cryptographic Protections – Cryptography-based security is an evolving area of research and there can be no guarantee that its current applications will be comprehensively effective at all times. Advancement in cryptography technologies and techniques are therefore unpredictable and developments such as (but not limited to) code cracking, the emergence of artificial intelligence-based tools and/or quantum computers could undermine or render ineffective cryptography-based systems including Tokens and/or the consensus mechanism underpinning the Ethereum Blockchain (or other relevant public blockchain networks, which may include for example, the NEO Protocol), resulting in the potential theft, loss, disappearance, destruction, devaluation or diminution in utility of Tokens.

**Abandonment or Development Failure** – The Issuer’s plans for the development of the Issuer Protocol are technically complex and to a degree involve new and relatively untested technologies, and the Issuer may encounter challenges in their implementation that are unforeseeable and/or unresolvable. Consequently, such development plans could fail or fail to function as intended, terminate or be delayed at any time for any reason (including, without limitation, on account of a lack of funds). Development failure or termination may render Tokens non transferable, or reduce the utility of or render obsolete any Tokens.
Theft of Token Sale Proceeds – The Issuer will endeavour to adopt industry best practices in maintaining secure and safe custody of the funds received from the sale of Tokens. Nevertheless, the Issuer and/or the Tokens Distributors (when applicable) may be subjected to attempts to steal such funds by sophisticated cyber-criminals and successful thefts may still occur. Any theft of Tokens sale proceeds could undermine the ability of the Issuer to provide funding for the development or maintenance of the Issuer Protocol.

**Flaws in Source Codes** – Although the Issuer has adopted and will adopt various quality assurance and audit procedures to help ensure that the source codes underpinning the Token Smart Contracts reflect their intended operation, they cannot be guaranteed to be error-free. Source codes may contain flaws, bugs, defects or inconsistencies that could compromise the predictability, usability, functionality, stability, and/or security of Tokens.

**Source Code Updates** – Source code modifications can lead to unexpected or unintended outcomes that may adversely affect the utility and integrity of Tokens, the Issuer Protocol and/or any associated services. As more fully set out in clause 23 of Section IV the Issuer will not be liable for any losses or other adverse outcome suffered by any prospective, current or former Tokens Holders as a result of such updates. Source code modifications that constitute upgrades to the Token Smart Contracts may be required in connection with the development of Tokens and/or services associated with such Tokens. If you fail to participate in any such upgrades, you may no longer be able to use some or all of your Tokens and your non-upgraded Tokens may lose some or all of their functionality.

**Risk of Mining Attacks** – The utility and integrity of any Tokens, the Issuer Protocol or any associated services may be undermined if the stability, integrity or security of the underlying public blockchain network (which initially will be the Ethereum Protocol and may subsequently expand or migrate to include others such as the NEO Protocol) is compromised. As these public blockchain networks are unpermissioned protocols, Tokens are potentially susceptible to bad faith attacks by the miners that are responsible for validating transactions, including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and selfish-mining attacks, any of which could compromise the accurate execution and recording of transactions involving such Tokens.

**Compromised Security** – The public blockchain networks underpinning Tokens comprise open source software and unpermissioned distributed ledgers. Accordingly, anyone may intentionally or unintentionally compromise the core infrastructural elements of such Tokens and their related Token Smart Contracts, resulting (either directly or following any suspension of such Token Smart Contracts) in their loss or diminution in their value, utility or functionality (including the temporary or permanent loss or restriction of access to the rights and services to which holders would otherwise be entitled in respect of such Tokens).

**Distributed Denial of Service and Other Cyber-Attacks** – The technology infrastructure supporting Tokens and the Issuer Protocol is and will be connected to a number of public and unpermissioned systems and is therefore at risk of cyber-attacks from hackers or other malicious actors attempting to subvert or compromise the operation of such systems, including distributed denial of service, Sybil, consensus-based, malware, smurfing or spoofing attacks. Such attacks could result in delays in Token transactions being recorded to the underlying public blockchain network and in extreme scenarios, render Tokens and/or the Issuer Protocol at any time, unusable for an extensive and undefined period of time.

**Inadequacy of Processing Power** – The ramp up of the platform supporting the Issuer Protocol may be accompanied by sharp increases in demand for processing power, leading to destabilisation and increased exposure to fraudulent transactions, which may adversely impact its usability, stability and security.

**Unauthorised Access to / Use of Tokens** – Tokens can be transferred or exploited in bad faith by any person who successfully gains access to the wallet or private keys linked to a Token Address through the use of hacking techniques, such as phishing scams or cracking the relevant Token Holder’s password. You are and will be solely responsible for implementing and maintaining adequate security measures (including but not limited to the use of two-factor authentication) for any wallet or private keys that you use to access and control your Tokens.

**Forking** – The temporary or permanent existence of forked blockchains on the public blockchain networks underpinning the Tokens could adversely impact the utility of such Tokens and the operation of the platform supporting the Issuer Protocol.
Popularity – The utility or the price of the Tokens is dependent on the popularity of the Issuer Protocol and the services associated with and accessible via such Tokens. A lack of active users could negatively impact the development and maintenance of the Issuer Protocol and its associated services, resulting in a loss or reduction in the utility of even the prices of the Tokens.

**Price Volatility and Liquidity** – As with many cryptographic tokens, Tokens may exhibit volatile prices and a lack of liquidity in secondary markets. The Issuer provides no guarantee or assurance that any Tokens acquired by any prospective or current Token Holder(s) will be readily transferable for value to third parties, whether through established trading exchanges or otherwise.

**The Issuer’s Exposure to Cryptographic Tokens** – The Issuer will hold certain funds in cryptographic tokens as a result of the issuance and sale of Tokens, which may in its sole and absolute discretion be converted over time in whole or in part into fiat currencies. Unfavourable fluctuations in the value of such Tokens could result in the failure or abandonment of the Issuer Protocol.

**Potential Competitors** – Other persons or groups may attempt to establish platforms that compete with or even outperform the Issuer Protocol, rendering it obsolete.

**Third Party Developers & Suppliers** - The Issuer Protocol will act as an open-access framework to accommodate various types of third party services, decentralized applications, smart contract programmes and ancillary services. The Issuer neither intends nor has the capabilities to scrutinize to any extent any applications, programmes or services to be developed on, connected to or otherwise associated with the Issuer Protocol.

**Privacy and Data Protection Issues** – The Issuer may collect personal information from prospective, current and former Token Holders. The collection and handling of such information is subject to the applicable laws and regulations on data protection, which could result in considerable financial resources being utilised to support compliance frameworks and potentially to settle fines or sanctions in the event of any breach, thereby limiting or undermining the development of the Issuer Protocol.

**Tax Matters Relating to the Issuer’s Operations** – If any tax authority successfully challenges the Issuer’s operational structure of its interpretation of any related tax liabilities, such liabilities could increase substantially. As a result, the financial resources of the Issuer (and consequently, the opportunity to use such resources to develop and support the Issuer Protocol) could be adversely impaired.

**Tax Matters Relating to Tokens** – The purchase, retention, utilisation or disposal of Tokens may have reporting implications and liabilities for holders of such Tokens. Furthermore, the taxation of cryptocurrencies is a complex and evolving area and the characterisation of Tokens and their associated rights may be subject to change. Such liabilities, obligations and re-characterisation risks shall be borne by the holders of Tokens entirely and solely. Prospective, current and former Token Holders should properly consider consulting their tax advisors prior to the acquisition of any Tokens and are solely responsible for ensuring that their acquisition, holding or disposal of Tokens and their use of any services associated with such Tokens comply with all tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions.

### SPECIFIC RISKS

**Risks Relating to the Identity Verification Services Market** – Blockpass Verification Services are potentially subject to a variety of national and international laws and regulations, including (without limitation) those governing KYC/Anti-Money Laundering and customer due diligence procedures, privacy and data protection, consumer protection and data security. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting these services could be enacted, which could impact the utility of Tokens. Furthermore, the providers of such services may be subject to industry-specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these providers fail to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, the development of the Blockpass Protocol could be adversely affected, and the utility  and even the prices of Tokens could be negatively impacted as a result.

**General Risks Relating to the Use of the Internet or Other Electronic Medium** – In addition to the risks described elsewhere in Appendixes 1 and 2, any use of the internet or other electronic media for the transmission of any communication, transaction or other information exposes you to the following risks:

1. 2.1 Unauthorised access/use, hacking or identity theft relating to the use of authentication technologies by or on behalf of the Issuer;
2. 2.2 Failures or delays in the transmission or communication of information; and
3. 2.3 Damage to the computer equipment you use in connection with any Tokens or the Blockpass Protocol caused by harmful agents (including any computer virus, malicious programs or harmful component).
